A related question to insincere questions classification is sarcasm detection, which is a frequently researched area in sentiment analysis\citep{joshi2017}. Sarcastic messages and insincere questions share many similarities in terms of their linguistic nature:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Sentiment Involvement:} Both sarcasm and rhetorical questions involve non-neutral sentiment under the disguise of a propositional or interrogative structure \citep{joshi2017, schmidt1977}. 
	\item \textbf{Presence of Indicative Words:} One type of insincere questions contain expressions of excusive absoluteness, such as \textit{``if not"}; other rhetorical questions have non-deontic modal verbs and some other special particles that strongly indicate its persuative, not interrogative, nature \citep{schmidt1977}. Similarly, sarcastic texts also involve indicative words, such as \textit{`like'} in \textit{``like you understand"} \citep{joshi2017}. 
	\item \textbf{Dropped Negation:} Many sarcastic sentences and rhetorical questions are meant to make a negative statement despite the absence of negation words  \citep{joshi2017, schmidt1977}. For instances, ``Having a cold is so fun" means ``Having a cold is not fun at all", and ``Can such a man be innocent?" means ``Such a man cannot be innocent."
	\item \textbf{Intended Victim:} Sarcastic comments can be used to mock a victim, and insincere questions can be discriminative or irrespectful against certain groups of people. The hurtful components in both situations may be implicit or explicit. 
	\item \textbf{Violation of Truthfulness:} Sarcastic comments that violate truthfulness resemble insincere questions that are based on false premises. To understand these languages, the listener needs to know the violation of truthfulness \citep{joshi2017}. This can be a hard problem in natural language processing as it largely depends on knowledge about certain people or certain topics. However, it is also possible the untruthful texts have syntactic or semantic characteristics.  
\end{enumerate}

Here we review several studies on sarcasm detection in the hope of transferring core concepts and methods to insincere question classification.

- A deeper look into sarcastic tweets using deep convolutional neural networks
\citep{poria2017}

In this study, the researchers presented a CNN architecture that contained in parallel a baseline 2-layer CNN model that directly process the text and three pre-trained models covering three types of clues (in particular, sentiments, emotions and personalities) that could be beneficial for sarcasm detection. These pre-trained models were trained on their benchmark datasets and then used for feature extraction on the sarcastic tweets datasets. To merge the outputs of the four components, the researchers tested two methods: combining the outputs using SVM and appending extracted features from the pre-trained models into the baseline CNN hidden layers. The former method showed better results possibly because appending the extracted features into the baseline models compromised their meaningfulness. \\Although the baseline features (directly extracted from the word vectors) showed better predictions than all pre-trained models, the combination of the baseline and pre-trained models yielded the best performance. The result indicated that compared to completely distributing word representations, modularized components with specific tasks could improved the overall performance of a CNN model. Since we have established several characteristics that indicate a Quora question to be insincere, the idea of combining various components each responsible for detecting different classification clues can be valuable for our project. \\ One additional lesson from this study is that their CNN model with a relatively lower feature dimension (at 1,100) outperformed models using larger vector size (>500,000) both in terms of accuracy and computation speed. 

- Fracking Sarcasm using Neural Network \citep{ghosh2016}

This work presented a CNN-LSTM-DNN neural networks model for semantic modelling to detect sarcastic tweets. Consider that the information-bearing parts of a text could exit anywhere, the choice of convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks was reasonable as both CNN and RNN were capable of capturing temporal sequential information. Among RNN implementations, LSTMs were beneficial because of the easiness to train and the avoidance of vanishing or exploding gradients. The combination of CNN and RNN networks were also advantageous for the following reasons: 1) convolutional layer helped to extract abstract and compact features to be used as inputs to LSTM network; 2) LSTM compensates for the disadvantage of fixed filter width of convolutional layers, allowing for better analysis of long-distance relationships over texts with various length; 3) CNN could reduce feature variations so that CNN-LSTM worked more efficiently. On top of the LSTM layers, the researchers added a fully-connected DNN layer to map the features into a more separable space. The combination of CNN, LSTM, and DNN showed more superior results than recursive SVM, two-layer CNN, and two-layer RNN models. Consider the similarity between the tasks of this study and our project, we can construct our neural networks architecture following this CNN-LSTM pattern. 

- Robust Sentiment Detection on Twitter from Biased and Noisy Data \citep{barbosa2010}

This work presented a 2-step sentiment analysis method that only utilized an SVM model for machine learning process, but its feature extraction methods allowed for robustness against noisy data. The researchers developed two feature sets designed to provide abstract representations of short texts: meta-features (including PoS tags and prior subjectivity and polarity) and syntactic features (namely frequencies of certain types of characters). The detection process were divided into two parts: subjectivity detection and polarity detection of the subjective texts. The experiment followed a traditional approach where the classifiers with highest information gain were created using Weka and the learning process were completed using SVM algorithm. Although this method no longer offers state-of-art performance, we still consider the feature selection methods valuable to our project. We intend to adapt the design in this study to obtain measurements of corpus statistics to feed as features into our neural network models. 

- Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentiment Analysis of Short Texts \citep{santos2014}

Compared to long texts that contain more contextual information, short texts sentiment analysis can be more challenging and thus methods such as bag-of-words or n-grams are shown to be less effective\citep{barbosa2010, santos2014}. In this study, the researchers proposed a deep CNN model that constructed word embeddings from character-level to sentence-level for sentiment analysis. Compared to the four-component CNN model in \citep{poria2017} which horizontally extracted information from different aspects, this model specialized in obtaining textual information in depth. The character-level embeddings captured morphological information and the word-level embeddings catched syntactical and semantical information. Finally, the sentence-level representations were contructed upon concatenated character-level and word-level features. The word-level embeddings came from Word2Vec embeddings, and the character-level and sentence-level were obtained using convolutional layers that successively extracted local features in windows and maxed over these windows to get the glocal representation. According to the results, the extracted features at sentence-level typically concentrated on several sentiment-bearing keyworsds. On the other hand, the contributions of character-level representations were not closely examined, so to what degree morphological and shape information benefited sentiment analysis were not clear. 


\subsection*{Word Embeddings}
A critical obstacle of language modeling is caused by the curse of dimensionality. In 2003, \citep{bengio2003neural} proposed a feadforwad Neural Network Language Model (NNLM) to learn a dense distributed representation\citep{hinton1986learning} for words, where both the word feature vectors and the parameters of that probability function are learned at the same time. NNLM was designed to learn $f \left( w _ { t } , \cdots , w _ { t - n + 1 } \right) = \hat { P } \left( w _ { t } | w _ { 1 } ^ { t - 1 } \right)$, $w _ { t } \in V$, where $w_1 \cdots w_T$ is the word sequence and $V$ is a large and finite vocabulary. This objective is divided into two steps: firstly the previous N words would be mapped into real vectors by a share projection matrix, which represents each word of the vocabulary with a distributed feature vectors; then the sequence of word feature vectors would be mapped into a probability distribution over $V$.

To learn the continuous word representations, \citep{mikolov2013efficient}
