# 3<sup>rd</sup> meeting with Frank, Feb 4
- Tell our project story
- Embeddings
	- Explain word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, and Bert)
	- feature based extraction (tokenization, PoS-tagging, number of adjectives)
- Explain downstream NN tasks
	- CNN-LSTM model
	- Merging word-embeddings with statistical features using DNN or SVM
- Questions
	- What if we train our own embeddings? Advantages would be: typos could be properly processed hopefully(they may appear to be similar to the correct-spelt ones);
	- Which part of our project would be the proper one for us to make innovative improvements?
